  <h2>Who are these handsome men?</h2>
  <p><b>Stray Kids</b> is a globally popular K-pop group formed by JYP Entertainment in 2017 by a survivial show of the same name. 
    <br><br>The group consists of 8 members: Bang Chan (leader), Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N. Their success mainly comes from their self-produced label; their producing unit, 3RACHA, consisting of CB97 (Bang Chan), SPEARB (Changbin), and J.One (Han), creates music of various genres in-house. Other units include DanceRacha (Lee Know, Hyunjin, and Felix) and VocalRacha (Seungmin and I.N.)
    <br><br>While there are designated positions such as vocalist, rapper, and dancer, all of the members are true all-rounders. One example is Changbin, whose ferocious rap contrasts beautifully with his soothing vocals. His performance on <i>King of Masked Singer</i> (Episodes 261-262) was truly amazing. Another member, Han, also appeared on <i>King of Masked Singer</i> in episode 197, and his singing actially introduced me to another artist! One day, I hope Bang Chan will appear on the show as well, so that all of 3RACHA will have participated.
