                <p>Hi, I'm Angel! I'm an ECE student at CMU with an intended additional major in Engineering Design, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. <br> I'm interested in software, security, and design. (bear with me with the lack of stylization on this page... It's definitely a work in progress.)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>18-100 Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering</li>
                    <p>I liked this class since it gave me a wide overview of the field of ECE and showed me that there's so much more than what you realize.</p>
                    <li>15-122 Principles of Imeprative Computing</li>
                    <p>This one I'm taking this semester. I'm eager to take my first CS class at a university known for its CS program.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Daily frontend development practice</li>
                    <p>Watch me develop my frontend engineering skills! <a href="https://github.com/angely32/frontend-learning-journey">This repo</a> will track my (hopefully) daily progress.</p>
                    <li>C++ Improvement</li>
                    <p>Fun fact, C++ was the first programming language I ever learned! I'm taking time to develop my skills and learn more about this popular language. <a href="https://github.com/angely32/cpp-practice">This repo</a> will track my progress.</a></p>
                    <li>and more! I have a lot of project ideas so I hope this list will eventually grow</li>

            <p>
                Outside of class, I'm interested in creative expression and visual storytelling. I often document my life through vlogs, which I film and edit myself, treating the process as both a creative outlet and a technical exercise. When I'm not creating, I enjoy exploring new experiences like trying different cuisines and visiting cafés — for the tea, not the coffee. 
                I'm also an avid music lover! I play four instruments and listen to a wide range of genres. I enjoy going to concerts, whether that's as an audience member or as part of the tech crew. I tend to overthink playlists the same way I overthink design decisions, and I enjoy noticing the small details, whether it's in a user interface or a live performance.
