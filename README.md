# frontend-learning-journey
This repository documents my journey learning frontend development.

Each file contains small exercises or mini-projects focused on learning core frontend languages. I will start out with HTML and branch out to CSS, JavaScript, React, and p5.    

Goal: gradual improvement and functioning portfolio page

Start: Jan 8, 2026 (01/08/26)  
Reflection: I currently have minimal knowledge of HTML. I've vibe-coded React with minimal understanding.

I created a blurb on Stray Kids, one of my favorite music groups. I utilized anchors and different types of text formatting to customize the page.
